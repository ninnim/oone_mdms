# TOU Validation Improvements - 24+ Hours & 7+ Days with AppToast ✅

## Updates Made

### 1. **Validation Logic Corrected**
Updated the validation to accept **24 hours and 7 days OR MORE**, not just exactly 24 hours and 7 days.

#### Before ❌
```dart
// Required exactly 24 hours and 7 days
if (hourCoverage < 24) {
  return 'Channel must have 24-hour coverage. Currently has X hours.';
}
if (dayCoverage < 7) {
  return 'Channel must have 7-day coverage. Currently has X days.';
}
```

#### After ✅
```dart
// Accepts 24+ hours and 7+ days
if (hourCoverage < 24.0) {
  return 'Channel must have 24-hour coverage or more. Currently has X hours (need at least 24.0 hours).';
}
if (dayCoverage < 7) {
  return 'Channel must have 7-day coverage or more. Missing days: X.';
}
```

### 2. **Replaced SnackBar with AppToast**
Changed all error/warning messages to use the existing AppToast system for consistent UI experience.

#### Before ❌
```dart
ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
  SnackBar(
    content: Text(coverageError),
    backgroundColor: AppColors.error,
    duration: const Duration(seconds: 5),
  ),
);
```

#### After ✅
```dart
AppToast.showError(
  context,
  error: coverageError,
  title: 'Coverage Validation Failed',
  duration: const Duration(seconds: 6),
);
```

### 3. **Enhanced Hour Coverage Calculation**
Removed the artificial 24-hour cap to properly calculate coverage that might exceed 24 hours due to overlapping time bands.

#### Before ❌
```dart
// Artificially capped at 24 hours
return totalHours > 24.0 ? 24.0 : totalHours;
```

#### After ✅
```dart
// Returns actual coverage to allow proper validation
return totalHours;
```

## Validation Rules

### ✅ **24+ Hour Coverage**
- **Minimum Required**: 24.0 hours
- **Accepted**: 24.0 hours or more
- **Calculation**: Merges overlapping time ranges to avoid double-counting
- **Overnight Handling**: Properly splits midnight-crossing periods

### ✅ **7+ Day Coverage** 
- **Minimum Required**: 7 days (Monday through Sunday)
- **Accepted**: All 7 days covered (no more than 7 unique days possible)
- **Configuration**: Must be explicitly set in time band day-of-week attributes
- **Missing Days**: Shows specific day names that need to be covered

### ✅ **Per-Channel Validation**
- **Independent**: Each channel validated separately
- **Complete**: Both hour and day requirements must be met
- **Detailed**: Specific error messages per channel
- **Blocking**: First validation failure stops the save process

## Error Messages Improved

### Missing Details Warning
```dart
AppToast.showWarning(
  context,
  message: 'Please add at least one time of use detail',
  title: 'Missing Details',
);
```

### Coverage Validation Error
```dart
AppToast.showError(
  context,
  error: coverageError, // Detailed message about what's missing
  title: 'Coverage Validation Failed',
  duration: const Duration(seconds: 6),
);
```

### Example Error Messages
- **Day Coverage**: `"Channel 'Energy Import' must have 7-day coverage or more. Missing days: Saturday, Sunday."`
- **Hour Coverage**: `"Channel 'Demand' must have 24-hour coverage or more. Currently has 20.5 hours (need at least 24.0 hours)."`
- **No Time Bands**: `"Channel 'Power Factor' has no valid time bands selected."`

## Benefits

### ✅ **Accurate Validation**
- Accepts configurations with 24+ hours and 7+ days coverage
- Properly handles overlapping time bands without artificial caps
- Validates each channel independently for complete coverage

### ✅ **Consistent UI Experience**
- Uses AppToast for all notifications (matches existing app patterns)
- Error messages have proper titles and longer duration for readability
- Warning vs error message types for different severity levels

### ✅ **Better User Feedback**
- Detailed error messages specify exactly what's missing
- Shows specific missing days by name (Monday, Tuesday, etc.)
- Indicates current coverage vs required coverage for hours
- Longer display duration (6 seconds) for complex error messages

### ✅ **Robust Calculation**
- Handles overnight time periods correctly (22:00-06:00)
- Merges overlapping time ranges to prevent double-counting
- Returns actual coverage values for proper validation logic
- Supports configurations that exceed minimum requirements

## Technical Implementation

### Hour Coverage Algorithm
1. **Parse Time Formats**: Converts HH:mm and HH:mm:ss to decimal hours
2. **Handle Overnight**: Splits midnight-crossing ranges into two periods
3. **Merge Overlaps**: Combines overlapping time ranges to avoid double-counting
4. **Calculate Total**: Returns actual coverage (can be ≥ 24.0 hours)

### Day Coverage Algorithm
1. **Extract Days**: Gets day-of-week attributes from time band configurations
2. **Validate Range**: Only accepts days 1-7 (Monday-Sunday)
3. **Count Unique**: Returns count of unique days covered (0-7)
4. **Identify Missing**: Shows specific missing day names in error messages

### Error Display Flow
1. **Validation Runs**: Before save operation, after form validation
2. **First Error Wins**: Stops on first validation failure for immediate feedback
3. **AppToast Display**: Shows error with 6-second duration and proper styling
4. **Save Blocked**: Prevents saving until all validation issues resolved

---

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**  
**Date**: August 5, 2025  
**Validation**: Accepts 24+ hours and 7+ days coverage per channel  
**UI**: Uses AppToast for consistent error messaging  
**Quality**: Robust calculation with proper edge case handling
