# TOU Validation Grid - Fixed Implementation

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Channel Filtering** ✅
- Added `selectedChannelIds` parameter to filter validation by specific channels
- Grid now only validates time slots for selected channels
- Header displays which channels are being validated with chips

### 2. **Improved Validation Logic** ✅
- **Proper Conflict Detection**: Only flags conflicts when multiple time bands affect the same channel at the same time
- **Channel Grouping**: Groups details by channel to detect conflicts accurately
- **Active Details Only**: Only considers active details in validation

### 3. **Enhanced Color Coding** ✅
- **Single Coverage**: Green background with time band-specific color overlay
- **Multiple Overlaps**: Yellow background with striped pattern showing all time bands
- **Conflicts**: Red background with red border for clear conflict indication
- **Empty Slots**: Surface color to clearly show uncovered time periods

### 4. **Visual Improvements** ✅
- **Dynamic Channel Display**: Shows up to 3 channels in header, with "+X more" for additional channels
- **Consistent Time Band Colors**: Each time band gets a consistent color across the grid
- **Enhanced Borders**: Different border styles for conflicts vs overlaps
- **Improved Legend**: Updated legend to reflect current validation logic

### 5. **Better Cell Content** ✅
- **Solid Colors**: Single time bands show as solid colored cells
- **Striped Patterns**: Multiple time bands show as striped cells
- **Alpha Transparency**: Consistent 0.8 alpha for better visibility

## Key Features

### Real-time Channel Filtering
```dart
// Filter details by selected channels
var filteredDetails = timeOfUseDetails.where((detail) => 
  detail.active && 
  (selectedChannelIds == null || selectedChannelIds!.contains(detail.channelId))
);
```

### Accurate Conflict Detection
```dart
// Check for conflicts within the same channel
bool hasConflict = false;
for (final channelDetails in channelGroups.values) {
  if (channelDetails.length > 1) {
    // Multiple time bands for same channel at same time = conflict
    final uniqueTimeBands = channelDetails.map((d) => d.timeBandId).toSet();
    if (uniqueTimeBands.length > 1) {
      hasConflict = true;
      break;
    }
  }
}
```

### Consistent Color Mapping
```dart
// Generate consistent color based on time band ID
final colors = [
  AppColors.primary,
  AppColors.success,
  AppColors.warning,
  AppColors.info,
  const Color(0xFF9C27B0), // Purple
  const Color(0xFF795548), // Brown
  const Color(0xFF607D8B), // Blue Grey
  const Color(0xFFE91E63), // Pink
  const Color(0xFF009688), // Teal
  const Color(0xFFFF5722), // Deep Orange
];
return colors[timeBandId % colors.length];
```

## Usage in Form Dialog

The grid is automatically filtered to show only the channels that have been selected in the current TOU details:

```dart
TOUFormValidationGrid(
  timeOfUseDetails: _details,
  availableTimeBands: _availableTimeBands,
  availableChannels: _availableChannels,
  selectedChannelIds: _details.map((d) => d.channelId).toSet().toList(),
  height: 320,
),
```

## Validation States

1. **Empty (Gray)**: No time band coverage for this time slot
2. **Covered (Green + Color)**: Single time band covering this slot
3. **Overlap (Yellow + Stripes)**: Multiple time bands but no conflict
4. **Conflict (Red + Border)**: Multiple conflicting time bands for same channel

## Status: ✅ Fixed and Enhanced

The TOU validation grid now provides:
- ✅ Accurate channel-filtered validation
- ✅ Proper conflict detection logic
- ✅ Enhanced visual feedback with correct colors
- ✅ Dynamic channel filtering display
- ✅ Real-time updates as form changes
- ✅ Consistent time band color mapping
