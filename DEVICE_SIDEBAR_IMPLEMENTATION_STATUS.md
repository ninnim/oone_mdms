# Device Sidebar and Summary Card Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a persistent, draggable sidebar for device details and a summary card for the device table view as requested by the user.

## Components Implemented

### 1. SidebarDrawer Widget (`lib/presentation/widgets/common/sidebar_drawer.dart`)
**Purpose**: Provides a reusable, draggable sidebar container that can be overlayed on any screen.

**Features**:
- **Persistent**: Stays open until explicitly closed by the user
- **Draggable**: Users can drag to resize the sidebar width
- **Modal Overlay**: Appears as an overlay with backdrop
- **Close Button**: X button in the top-right corner to close the sidebar
- **Styled**: Consistent with the app's design system
- **Responsive**: Adapts to different screen sizes

**Key Properties**:
- `child`: Widget to display inside the sidebar
- `onClose`: Callback when the close button is pressed
- Minimum width: 400px
- Maximum width: 60% of screen width
- Dark background with rounded corners and shadow

### 2. DeviceSidebarContent Widget (`lib/presentation/widgets/devices/device_sidebar_content.dart`)
**Purpose**: Displays detailed device information in tabbed format within the sidebar.

**Features**:
- **Tabbed Interface**: 4 tabs - Metrics, Billing, Group, Schedule
- **Device Header**: Shows device serial number and name with primary color background
- **Tab Content**:
  - **Metrics Tab**: Device information, status, and location
  - **Billing Tab**: Billing information with informational message
  - **Group Tab**: Device group details with explanatory message
  - **Schedule Tab**: Schedule information with explanatory message
- **Status Chips**: Color-coded status indicators for device and link status
- **Information Cards**: Well-structured data presentation with headers and rows

**Data Displayed**:
- Device serial number, model, type, manufacturer
- Device status (Commissioned/None) and link status (MULTIDRIVE/E-POWER/None)
- Device group ID and information
- Address/location information
- Billing and schedule placeholders for future development

### 3. DeviceSummaryCard Widget (`lib/presentation/widgets/devices/device_summary_card.dart`)
**Purpose**: Displays a summary of device statistics under the filters in the device table view.

**Features**:
- **4 Key Metrics**: Total Devices, Commissioned, Smart Meters, Connected
- **Visual Design**: Card-based layout with icons and color coding
- **Real-time Calculation**: Automatically calculates statistics from the current device list
- **Responsive Layout**: 4 equal-width columns with proper spacing

**Statistics Tracked**:
- **Total Devices**: Count of all devices in the current filtered list
- **Commissioned**: Devices with status = "commissioned"
- **Smart Meters**: Devices with device type = "smart meter"
- **Connected**: Devices with non-empty link status (MULTIDRIVE/E-POWER)

## Integration Changes

### DevicesScreen Updates (`lib/presentation/screens/devices/devices_screen.dart`)
**Key Changes**:
1. **Added Sidebar State Management**:
   - `_isSidebarOpen`: Boolean to track sidebar visibility
   - `_sidebarDevice`: Currently selected device for sidebar content

2. **Updated Row Click Behavior**:
   - Changed `onRowTap`, `onView` actions to open sidebar instead of navigating to device details
   - Added `_openSidebar()` method to set sidebar state and selected device
   - Added `_closeSidebar()` method to close sidebar and clear selected device

3. **Updated Main Content Layout**:
   - Wrapped content in `Stack` to support sidebar overlay
   - Added `DeviceSummaryCard` under filters
   - Added conditional `SidebarDrawer` overlay when sidebar is open

4. **Preserved Existing Functionality**:
   - All existing table features (sorting, filtering, pagination) remain intact
   - Edit and delete actions remain unchanged
   - Multi-select functionality preserved
   - Navigation breadcrumbs and deep linking preserved

## User Experience Flow

1. **Device Table View**: User sees device list with summary card showing key statistics
2. **Row Click**: Clicking on any device row opens the persistent sidebar with device details
3. **Sidebar Interaction**: User can view device information across 4 tabs (Metrics, Billing, Group, Schedule)
4. **Device Switching**: Clicking on different device rows updates the sidebar content without closing it
5. **Sidebar Management**: User can drag to resize sidebar or click X button to close it
6. **Persistent State**: Sidebar remains open until explicitly closed, even when switching between devices

## Technical Implementation Details

### State Management
- Used Flutter's built-in `setState()` for local sidebar state
- Maintained existing Provider pattern for device data
- No breaking changes to existing state management

### Performance Considerations
- Lazy loading: Sidebar content only rendered when sidebar is open
- Efficient updates: Only sidebar content re-renders when device changes
- Minimal impact on table performance

### Design Consistency
- Follows existing app color scheme and design system
- Uses consistent spacing, typography, and component styling
- Integrates seamlessly with existing UI components

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files Created:
1. `lib/presentation/widgets/common/sidebar_drawer.dart` - Reusable sidebar container
2. `lib/presentation/widgets/devices/device_sidebar_content.dart` - Device-specific sidebar content
3. `lib/presentation/widgets/devices/device_summary_card.dart` - Summary statistics card

### Modified Files:
1. `lib/presentation/screens/devices/devices_screen.dart` - Added sidebar integration and summary card

## Code Quality
- **Type Safety**: All code properly typed with null safety
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of null/empty values
- **Accessibility**: Proper semantic widgets and labels
- **Maintainability**: Modular, reusable components
- **Performance**: Efficient rendering and state management

## Future Enhancements
1. **Real Billing Data**: Connect billing tab to actual device billing readings API
2. **Schedule Management**: Integrate with schedule service for real schedule data
3. **Device Groups**: Connect group tab to device group management
4. **Animations**: Add smooth open/close animations for sidebar
5. **Keyboard Navigation**: Add keyboard shortcuts for sidebar operations
6. **Mobile Optimization**: Optimize sidebar behavior for mobile devices

## Success Criteria Met ✅
1. ✅ **Persistent Sidebar**: Sidebar stays open until explicitly closed
2. ✅ **Row Click Integration**: Clicking device rows opens/updates sidebar
3. ✅ **Content Updates**: Sidebar content changes when different rows are clicked
4. ✅ **Close Button**: X button to close sidebar
5. ✅ **Device Details**: Displays metrics, billing, group, and schedule information
6. ✅ **Summary Card**: Statistics card displayed under filters
7. ✅ **Draggable**: Sidebar can be resized by dragging
8. ✅ **No Dismissal**: Sidebar doesn't auto-dismiss, only closes via close button
9. ✅ **Design Consistency**: Matches app's design system and color scheme
10. ✅ **Error-Free**: All components compile and run without critical errors
