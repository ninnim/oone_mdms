# TOU Validation Grid - Error Fix

## Issue Fixed ✅

The error was caused by the `tou_form_validation_grid.dart` file being empty, which made the `TOUFormValidationGrid` class unavailable.

### Solution Applied:
1. **Restored Complete File**: Recreated the full `TOUFormValidationGrid` class with all functionality
2. **Verified Import Path**: Confirmed the import statement is correct in the form dialog
3. **Checked Class Definition**: Ensured the class name matches the usage

### File Structure:
```
lib/presentation/widgets/time_of_use/
├── time_of_use_form_dialog.dart (imports and uses TOUFormValidationGrid)
└── tou_form_validation_grid.dart (defines TOUFormValidationGrid class)
```

### Key Features Restored:
- ✅ Channel filtering with `selectedChannelIds` parameter
- ✅ Real-time validation with proper conflict detection
- ✅ Visual grid with 24h × 7d layout
- ✅ Color-coded cells showing coverage, overlaps, and conflicts
- ✅ Statistics display with coverage percentage
- ✅ Dynamic channel display in header
- ✅ Legend explaining validation states

### Usage in Form Dialog:
```dart
TOUFormValidationGrid(
  timeOfUseDetails: _details,
  availableTimeBands: _availableTimeBands,
  availableChannels: _availableChannels,
  selectedChannelIds: _details.map((d) => d.channelId).toSet().toList(),
  height: 320,
),
```

## Status: ✅ Fixed
The compilation error should now be resolved. The `TOUFormValidationGrid` class is properly defined and imported.
