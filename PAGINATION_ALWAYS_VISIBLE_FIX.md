# Pagination Always Visible Fix - COMPLETE ✅

## Issue Fixed
When filtering data with high item limits (e.g., 50) but having fewer actual results (e.g., 20), pagination was being hidden because there was only 1 page. User requested pagination to always be visible regardless of page count.

## Root Cause
In `ResultsPagination` widget at line 95, there was a conditional rendering:
```dart
// OLD - Conditional rendering
if (widget.totalPages > 1) _buildPageNavigation(theme),
```

This caused pagination controls to disappear when `totalPages = 1`.

## Solution Applied
**File**: `lib/presentation/widgets/common/results_pagination.dart`
**Change**: Removed the conditional check so pagination is always visible

```dart
// NEW - Always visible
_buildPageNavigation(theme),
```

## Impact
✅ **Pagination now always visible** - Users can see page controls even with 1 page  
✅ **Consistent UI experience** - No layout shifts when data changes  
✅ **Better UX** - Page information and controls always accessible  
✅ **No breaking changes** - All functionality preserved  

## Behavior Changes

### Before:
- Filter to 50 items per page with only 20 results → Pagination hidden
- User sees empty space where pagination should be
- Layout shifts when data changes page count

### After:
- Filter to 50 items per page with only 20 results → Pagination visible
- Shows "Page 1 of 1" with disabled navigation buttons
- Consistent layout regardless of data volume

## Technical Details

The `_generatePageNumbers()` method correctly handles single-page scenarios:
- Returns `[1]` when `totalPages = 1`
- Navigation buttons are properly disabled when appropriate
- Page input field shows current state

## Verification

The fix ensures pagination is always displayed in:
- Device Groups screen
- Seasons screen  
- Sites screen
- Devices screen
- TOU Form Dialog
- Any screen using `ResultsPagination` widget

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

All screens now consistently show pagination controls regardless of the number of pages, providing a stable and predictable user interface.
