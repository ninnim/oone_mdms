# Time of Use (TOU) 24-Hour & 7-Day Validation - Complete ✅

## Implementation Overview
Added comprehensive validation to ensure that each channel in a Time of Use (TOU) configuration has complete 24-hour and 7-day coverage before saving. This prevents incomplete TOU configurations that could cause operational issues.

## Validation Requirements
- **24-Hour Coverage**: Each channel must have time bands that cover all 24 hours of the day
- **7-Day Coverage**: Each channel must have time bands that cover all 7 days of the week
- **Per-Channel Validation**: Validation is performed separately for each channel
- **Error Messaging**: Clear, specific error messages indicate what coverage is missing

## Implementation Details

### 1. Main Validation Method
```dart
String? _validateChannelCoverage() {
  // Groups details by channel ID
  // Validates each channel independently
  // Returns detailed error message or null if valid
}
```

### 2. Hour Coverage Calculation
```dart
double _calculateHourCoverage(List<TimeBand> timeBands) {
  // Converts time strings to hours (e.g., "14:30" -> 14.5)
  // Handles overnight periods (e.g., 22:00-06:00)
  // Merges overlapping time ranges
  // Returns total hours covered (0.0 to 24.0)
}
```

### 3. Day Coverage Calculation
```dart
int _calculateDayCoverage(List<TimeBand> timeBands) {
  // Extracts day-of-week attributes from time bands
  // Counts unique days covered (1=Monday, 7=Sunday)
  // Returns number of days covered (0 to 7)
}
```

### 4. Time Parsing Logic
```dart
double? _parseTimeToHours(String timeStr) {
  // Parses "HH:mm" or "HH:mm:ss" format
  // Converts to decimal hours for calculation
  // Handles edge cases and invalid formats
}
```

### 5. Error Message Generation
```dart
List<String> _getMissingDays(List<TimeBand> timeBands) {
  // Identifies which specific days are missing
  // Returns human-readable day names
  // Used for detailed error messages
}
```

## Validation Logic Flow

### 1. **Channel Grouping**
- Groups TOU details by channel ID
- Each channel is validated independently
- Ensures no channel is overlooked

### 2. **Time Band Collection**
- Collects all time bands used by each channel
- Validates that time bands exist and are properly configured
- Handles missing or invalid time band references

### 3. **Hour Coverage Validation**
- Converts time band start/end times to decimal hours
- Handles overnight periods by splitting into two ranges
- Merges overlapping time ranges to avoid double-counting
- Validates total coverage equals 24.0 hours

### 4. **Day Coverage Validation**
- Extracts day-of-week attributes from time band configurations
- Validates that all 7 days (Monday-Sunday) are covered
- Provides specific missing day names in error messages

### 5. **Error Reporting**
- Returns detailed error messages for first validation failure
- Includes channel name and specific missing coverage
- Stops validation on first error for immediate user feedback

## Error Message Examples

### Missing Day Coverage
```
Channel "Energy Import" must have 7-day coverage. 
Missing days: Saturday, Sunday.
```

### Missing Hour Coverage
```
Channel "Demand" must have 24-hour coverage. 
Currently has 20.5 hours of 24.0 hours.
```

### No Time Bands
```
Channel "Power Factor" has no valid time bands selected.
```

## Integration Points

### 1. **Save Method Integration**
```dart
Future<void> _save() async {
  // Form validation
  // Empty details check
  // NEW: Channel coverage validation
  // Register code updates
  // API save operation
}
```

### 2. **Validation Timing**
- Validates before any save operation
- Prevents invalid configurations from being saved
- Shows immediate feedback via SnackBar

### 3. **Error Display**
- Red SnackBar with 5-second duration
- Clear, actionable error messages
- Prevents save operation until resolved

## Technical Features

### ✅ **Overnight Period Handling**
- Properly handles time ranges that cross midnight
- Example: 22:00-06:00 becomes [22:00-24:00] + [00:00-06:00]
- Prevents calculation errors for night shifts

### ✅ **Overlapping Range Merging**
- Combines overlapping time ranges to avoid double-counting
- Example: [08:00-12:00] + [10:00-14:00] = [08:00-14:00]
- Ensures accurate hour coverage calculation

### ✅ **Robust Time Parsing**
- Handles multiple time formats (HH:mm, HH:mm:ss)
- Gracefully handles invalid time strings
- Returns null for unparseable times

### ✅ **Channel Name Resolution**
- Uses actual channel names from available channels
- Falls back to "Channel X" for missing channels
- Provides clear identification in error messages

### ✅ **Precise Coverage Calculation**
- Uses decimal hours for accurate calculations
- Handles minutes and seconds properly
- Caps maximum coverage at 24.0 hours

## Validation Rules

### Hour Coverage Requirements
- **Minimum**: 24.0 hours (full day)
- **Calculation**: Decimal hours with minute precision
- **Overnight**: Automatically handled by range splitting
- **Overlaps**: Merged to prevent double-counting

### Day Coverage Requirements
- **Minimum**: 7 days (full week)
- **Day Format**: 1=Monday, 2=Tuesday, ..., 7=Sunday
- **Configuration**: Must be explicitly set in time band attributes
- **Missing Days**: Specific day names provided in error messages

### Channel-Specific Validation
- **Independent**: Each channel validated separately
- **Complete**: Both hour and day coverage required
- **Detailed**: Specific error messages per channel
- **Blocking**: First failure stops validation

## Benefits

### ✅ **Data Integrity**
- Prevents incomplete TOU configurations
- Ensures operational readiness before deployment
- Catches configuration errors early

### ✅ **User Experience**
- Clear, actionable error messages
- Immediate feedback during save operation
- Specific guidance on what needs to be fixed

### ✅ **System Reliability**
- Prevents runtime errors from incomplete configurations
- Ensures consistent time coverage across all channels
- Validates before database persistence

### ✅ **Maintenance Efficiency**
- Detailed error messages reduce support tickets
- Clear validation rules prevent common mistakes
- Proactive error prevention vs reactive troubleshooting

## Testing Scenarios

### Valid Configurations ✅
- All channels have complete 24-hour, 7-day coverage
- Overlapping time ranges properly merged
- Overnight periods correctly handled

### Invalid Configurations ❌
- Missing hours (e.g., 20-hour coverage)
- Missing days (e.g., no weekend coverage)
- No time bands selected for channel

### Edge Cases ✅
- Midnight crossing time ranges
- Multiple overlapping time bands
- Invalid time format handling
