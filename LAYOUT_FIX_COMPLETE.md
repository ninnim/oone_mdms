# Layout Fix - Unbounded Width Constraints Issue ✅

## Issue Fixed
**Problem**: RenderFlex children have non-zero flex but incoming width constraints are unbounded.

## Root Cause
The `IntrinsicHeight` widget wrapping the filter `Row` was causing layout constraint issues when the parent didn't provide finite width constraints. The `Expanded` widgets inside the `Row` couldn't determine their size within an unbounded width context.

## Solution Applied
1. **Removed IntrinsicHeight**: Eliminated the `IntrinsicHeight` wrapper that was causing constraint conflicts
2. **Simplified Row Structure**: Used a standard `Row` with `Expanded` widgets for proper flex behavior
3. **Maintained UI Consistency**: Kept all styling and functionality intact

## Changes Made
- Removed `IntrinsicHeight` widget wrapper from `_buildValueFiltersCard()`
- Changed `Row(mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min)` to `Row()` 
- Kept `Expanded` widgets for proper space distribution
- Fixed syntax errors and closing parentheses

## Result
✅ **Layout crash fixed** - No more unbounded width constraint errors
✅ **No compile errors** - All syntax issues resolved
✅ **UI preserved** - All filters and functionality maintained
✅ **Performance optimized** - Simpler widget tree structure

## Technical Details
- **Before**: `IntrinsicHeight(child: Row(mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min, children: [Expanded...]))`
- **After**: `Row(children: [Expanded...])`
- **Impact**: Resolved RenderFlex constraint conflicts while maintaining UI design

The metrics enhancement features are now **fully functional** without layout crashes.
